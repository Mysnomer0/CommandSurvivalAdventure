Fix piece of bug and salt chunk bug

Blocking does not work when using hands

When two people enter a chunk at the same time, the following error occurs in World line 148: System.ArgumentException: 'An item with the same key has already been added. Key: 60'
Looks like a race condition where it tried to generate the chunk once, than again when the other person joined the chunk.
