How to add new plants

Adding plants is actually quite simple, a two step process.  

First, you'll need to create the plant class itself along with any classes it needs.  
See CommandSurvivalAdventure.World.Plants.PlantExamplePlant for an example piece of code for creating your own plant.
If your plant needs branches or some other plant part that will be it's own seperate object, check out hte PlantParts namespace inside of World.Plants.
Simply follow the example of the rest of the plants by creating a new namespace specifically for that plant, and putting any plant parts inside this new namespace.

Second, you'll need to go into the code of each biome that you want this new plant to be generated in and have it get generated.
For example, if you wanted to make your new plant get generated in the forest, you would go into World.Biomes.Forest, in the generate function, add a new piece of code that would attach a random amount of your new plant to the chunk.


You should be good to go!  Have fun with your new plant!
